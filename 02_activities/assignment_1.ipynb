    "The enhanced summary did generally score better. Giving the model its evaluation feedback helps it address specific weaknesses, though the gains weren't dramatic. Safety was basically a freebie since the source material is a management article with nothing controversial in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't think these controls are enough on their own though. The biggest issue is that the evaluator and the generator are the same model, so it's basically grading its own homework. A more robust setup would use a different model for evaluation, or better yet, bring in human reviewers for a sample of outputs. There are also diminishing returns if you kept looping the enhancement step, and each round costs more tokens. Tonality is pretty subjective too, since the G-Eval can check for passive voice and formal language but different evaluation prompts might score the same text very differently. There's also a tension between summarization coverage and brevity, where the assessment questions want specific concepts mentioned which pushes toward longer summaries at the cost of being concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a production system you'd want human-in-the-loop checks and cross-model evaluation on top of this kind of automated pipeline."
